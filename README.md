# Student-Dashboard

Inspiration
Hi! We are the team Cookie, we are two highschool students from Vancouver. We’ve made a dashboard for youth to keep track of any school related tasks, especially in light of online schooling. The app consists of multiple widgets, including an assignment tracker, notes, goal setter, calendar, music playlist, and Youtube video player. By adding these widgets onto one page, we’re eliminating the need to switch back and forth between multiple apps, saving time and more importantly, preventing students from social media distractions while navigating through different websites.

How we built it/ Problem that came out during the project
We used HTML, CSS, and react to build our app, and Figma and Canva to design it. The biggest problems we ran into were making the React code work and optimizing CSS for different screen sizes. One issue we encountered was the screen dimension problem. While working on the interface together, the CSS looked different and incorrectly positioned for some of us in the team because we didn’t realize we had huge screen dimension differences. We ended up making some widgets scroll to fix this issue.

Accomplishment / what we learned
We practiced using git to collaborate together. And oftentimes, this can lead to merge conflicts which we have to solve. We were able to learn more about stashing and resolving the problems. We also learned to make design on figma effectively.

What’s next for our app?
So those are the main functions of our dashboard app.We hope to bring productivity to students by bringing essential educational tools all in one space! We plan to improve this website further by making this mobile responsive and adding user log in to keep track of every’s student’s workplace! Despite the little time we had, we’re still really happy with what we came up with over the weekend and would love to continue this project and make it even better going into the future!
